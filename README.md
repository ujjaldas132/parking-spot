This project aims to detect whether a spot is clear to park a car or it is already filled.


<br/> To use this module
<br/> - run the `main.py` in the asset folder
<br/> - select the rectancle spots by clicking the four corner of it which spot you want to observe
<br/> - if want to go to the initial stage `press r`
<br/> - if you make any mistake in selecting the spots , again select the box over the incorrect  box.
 the last box you draw will be consider as final box for that the spot .
<br/> - if you done with selecting the spots `press q`
<br/><br/>and just chill




## Future work
- right now we detect whether there is a car or not by just taking the average of the pixel . in future i want to crop the spots and pass to 
some classifier so that we can correctly detect car on the spots .
