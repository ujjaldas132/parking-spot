## Future work
- Hook up a webcam to a Raspberry Pi and have live parking monitoring at home!
- [Transform parking lot video to have overview perspective](http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_imgproc/py_geometric_transformations/py_geometric_transformations.html) (for clearer rectangles)
- Experiment with [HOG descriptors](https://gurus.pyimagesearch.com/lesson-sample-histogram-of-oriented-gradients-and-car-logo-recognition/) to detect people or other objects of interest
