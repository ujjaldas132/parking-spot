This project aims to detect whether a spot is clear to park a car or it is already filled.


<br/> To use this module
<br/> `run the main.py in the asset folder`
<br/> `select the rectancle spots by clicking the four corner of it which spot you want to observe`
<br/> `if want to go to the initial stage press r`
<br/> `if you make any mistake in selecting the spots , again select the box over the previous box. the last box you draw over that place will be consider as final box`
<br/> `if you done with selecting the spots press q`
and just chill




## Future work
- right now we detect whethere there is a car or not by just taking the average of the pixel . in future i want to crop the spots and pass to 
some classifier so that we can correctly detect car on the spots .
